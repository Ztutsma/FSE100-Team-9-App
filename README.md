# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### If the project does not run in Replit

Try switching to the shell and running the following commands:
1. `npm cache clean --force`
2. `rm -r node_modules/`
3. `npm install`

These steps will clean the npm cache and reinstall the node modules. This may take several minutes but usually fixes the issue.
